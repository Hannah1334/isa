<h1>Basic Information</h1>
<b>Name:</b> Isa<br>
<b>True Age:</b> Unknown<br>
<b>Physical Age:</b> Late Twenties<br>
<b>Birthdate:</b> Unknown<br>
<b>Gender:</b> Female<br>
<b>Sexuality:</b> Demisexual<br>
<b>Species:</b> Anomaly<br>
<b>Race:</b> Gray<br>
<b>Height:</b> 6'0"<br>
<b>Weight:</b> 140 lbs.
<br><br>
<h1>Detailed Information</h1>
<b>Appearance</b><br>
<i>Physique/Build</i>: She's tall for the average humanoid female, but not to an extreme. Despite her height she's very thin and lithe, retaining a shapely hourglass figure without having too much in the chest or rear to weigh her down. Hard muscle underlies her pale flesh and is even a little visible in most cases giving her the look of an athlete trained for agility and and endurance.
<br>
<i>Hair/Facial</i>: Silver hair, the length and style of which varies frequently, most often finds itself tied back for the sake of being kept out of her way. Bangs and stubborn strands still find themselves framing her soft features. Isa has a strong angular jaw, but it is softened by her rounded cheeks, giving her head more of an upside-down teardrop shape. For those that can stand to be in her presence the finer details of her facial structure are found to be quite pretty and fulfilling, as a cute button nose sits at its very center, accented by a pair of full rosy pink lips and big wonder-filled liquid silver eyes. Even her lashes and slender brows are colored the same chromatic hue shared by her irises and hair. 
<br><br>
<b>Personality</b><br>
Isa is most certainly a hard woman to read. When she is not in danger, her demeanor is very child-like to the extreme. Many question her mental development and find themselves wondering if she is "slow" or "special needs." However, when extreme pressure is applied, especially when breaking under it or messing up would lead to her own death, Isa becomes a very cold and calculating individual. Something seems to snap behind her dull eyes, igniting a fierce cleverness often hidden or at least turned off for most of her down time.

<h1>Passive Abilities of the Gray</h1>
<p align="center"><img style="height:45%;" src="https://i.imgur.com/64NNcD8.jpg"/> <img style="height:45%;" src="https://i.imgur.com/ovOb2Vc.jpg"/></p>
<b>Biological Process</b><br>
The anomaly of her physical existence ages much like the common mortal man, until reaching maturity. Once her body and mind have accomplished their peak development, instead of deteriorating she simply stops growing or aging altogether. Isa is still as vulnerable as most mortals, capable from dying to any natural cause save for old age.
<br><br>
<b>Muscle Mass</b><br>
Her muscles provide twice the durability and strength of the average human’s, but for half as much mass and weight. If she were thin and average in weight, at her base and in an untrained state, her strength would still surpass others of her build. Isa’s body is trained, however, her muscles especially. Not to the extreme, but enough to make a marginal difference and rival even professional weightlifters and bodybuilders.
<br><br>
<b>Bone Composition</b><br>
The durability of her skeletal structure far surpasses that of any human comparison. It is rumored to rival some of the strongest materials known to--and readily available to--mankind.
<br><br>
<b>Enhanced Dexterity & Flexibility</b><br>
Her capacity for staying upright and balancing on all kinds of surfaces is incredible, as well as her ability to contort her body into various shapes. She can bend herself and flip about like a trained acrobatic contortionist.
<br><br>
<b>Adaptability</b><br>
Isa is built for survival, allowing her to change in ways that can be argued as a minor form of evolution. This mostly has to do with environmental changes, like being able to keep warm enough to survive easily in freezing climates with minimal clothing, or keeping cool in searingly warm environments. Another good example is her flesh being able to adapt to the intensity of direct sunlight depending on her location, preventing things like sunburns as a result. If there are any extremes different than what she is used to in her present environment, given enough time in complete exposure to the new terrain and atmosphere will trigger the chemical changes in her makeup necessary for survival.
<br><br>
<b>Glitched Existence</b><br>
Being a sentient piece of such perfect balance, a literal embodiment of a moral grey area some may say, allows her to fade easily into the background of her surroundings so to speak. No, she does not camouflage, it is just easier for the untrained eye to slip past her as though she were never there to begin with. That being said, anyone who is not used to her presence (or anyone who finds her in the process of adapting before having fit herself into their native environment) and actually pays her mind will be met with malicious headaches and nausea. Her entire existence feels very wrong to natural instincts, as though she is some kind of abomination, and adverse effects vary greatly depending on one’s exposure to the otherworldly. Those with none whatsoever could even be triggered into seizing at first, since her presence comes off as so intruding and almost destructive without any actual intent to harm.

<h1>Eternal Mate</h1>
Isa's travels have led her far and wide across the multiverse, and throughout all the different beings she'd ever met only one had managed to hold her heart permanently. His world and way of life were completely foreign to her, but she gladly settled down and grew to know his ways.
